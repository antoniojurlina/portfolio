##### **Summary**

In an attempt to venture solo, while an undergraduate student in economics, I worked on a probit model designed to study the effect traffic congestion has on satisfaction with work and place of residence. The question seemed straightforward, and the dependent variables were already either presented as binary or Likert scales that could be easily turned into one. Data came from the city of Cardiff, UK, in the form of an online questionnaire. I find that an increase in the perceived level of congestion makes individuals less happy with working and living in Cardiff. After adjusting for all the potential issues (like hetersokedasticity) this data might have, the results seem quite robust across two probit models. Included, also, is a link to the GitHub [repository](https://github.com/antoniojurlina/econometrics) containing the data I worked with and the Stata do-file.

**1. Review**

Adam Smith (1776), with the publication of the Wealth of the Nations, instigated a debate around the causes of economic growth. Although mercantilism had dominated the period of late Renaissance in Europe and powerful merchants had built routes based on the belief that trade would benefit them greatly (McCusker & Morgan, 2001), it wasn’t until Smith’s work had been published that attention turned towards free trade, production advantage, economies of scale and institutions (or lack thereof) intended to orchestrate this in unison. This work was further expanded by Ricardo (1817), who ushered the realization that benefits can be acquired even by those countries that are not the most efficient suppliers around. Eventually, economic growth was taken up by the likes of Solow (1956), who had expanded the Harrod-Domar model (Domar, 1946; Harrod, 1939) so that growth is represented as function of capital, labor and technology (with more optimistic limitations).

Following Solow’s work, Kuznets (1973) argued that, while necessary, technology itself wouldn’t suffice in producing measurable growth. He claimed that growth would induce change along the way (something along the lines of Schumpeter, 1942), and all the conflict would have to be resolved cost-effectively through institutions designed to do so. Only then, with conflict resolution costs smaller than benefits of growth, would long-term economic progress occur. Finally, there is Milton Friedman (1962), crafting institutional approach along more libertarian lines, arguing for a government that is there to promote safety, monopolize violence and influence the economy through the money supply. He also argued for the removal of major trade barriers as the only way to introduce stable equilibria.

More recent work had found that property rights, monetary stability, and freedom to trade internationally all have visible impact on growth (Ayal & Karras, 1998; Barro, 1991; Easterly, 1992; Knack & Keefer, 1995; Torstensson, 1994). Additionally, previously underdeveloped, closed-off, and/or countries with centralized economies had all undergone drastic economic changes (in the positive direction) upon loosening institutional grips, opening towards the world and openly stifling hierarchical corruption. This can be observed in the economies of Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong, with China following closely upon realizing its neighbors had adopted a slightly more laissez-faire approach and experienced significant growth (Naughton, 2007).

Market equilibria inside closed economies adjust themselves according to supply and demand interactions and institutional involvement. With constraints effectively placed to incorporate the costs of most inefficiencies, effective resource allocation is determined on aggregate, through interactions of all the individual participants. With current levels of globalization and economic interconnectedness, eliminating quotas and barriers results in a world- wide market place with freer price points. This, much like on a single-country level, is an amalgamation of countless interactions producing an inherent equilibrium. Depending on the institutional restrictions imposed by all the individual players (and their size), this equilibrium will inch towards comparative efficiency, fostering more growth. With the readjustment of the production possibility frontiers to accommodate the new demand and supply pressures, Mundell and Fleming (Mundell, 1963; Fleming, 1962) identify certain factors affecting GDP levels of open- economies: fiscal policy, monetary policy, and foreign trade shifts. Even if Leonteif’s (1953) observations (the failure of H-O theorem) hold across countries, there is still an adjustment shift according to the world market.

Finally, (Gwartney, Lawson, & Block, 1996), have created an index consisting of all these factors influencing growth. The index rates the economic freedom of countries on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 indicating a country that is completely free economically. The Economic Freedom Index (from here on referred to as EFI), is comprised of separate indices for the size of the government, legal system and property rights, freedom to trade internationally, stability of the monetary policy, and the number of regulatory obstacles. This index, and similar ones (such as the one produced by the Heritage Foundation) have been used in several ways in order to determine a possible causal link between economic freedom and economic growth (Berggren, 2003; Carlsson & Lundström, 2002; de Haan & Sturm, 2000; Gwartney, Lawson, & Holcombe, 1999; Nelson & Singh, 1998).

**2. Econometric Model**

The EFI is published yearly by the Fraser Institute. Latest edition (Gwartney et al., 2015) is comprised of five areas used to construct a scale of economic freedom, with each area rated on a scale of 1 to 10. Size of Government focuses on individual choice-making through market interactions, as opposed to relying on policy making. Countries with low levels of government
spending, a smaller government enterprise sector, and lower tax rates earn the highest ratings in this area. Legal System and Property Rights focuses on unbiased judiciary systems, effective protection of private property and impartial enforcement of the law. Countries that satisfy these categories the best, score the highest in this area. Sound Money refers to money with a stable purchasing power over time. Countries that score high in this area, must follow policies and adopt institutions that lead to low rates of inflation and avoid regulations that limit the ability to use alternative currencies. Freedom to Trade Internationally focuses on the level and ease of interactions across the borders. To score high in this area, a country must have “low tariffs, easy clearance and efficient administration of customs, a freely convertible currency, and few controls on the movement of physical and human capital” (Gwartney, Lawson, & Block, 2015). Regulation measures the access into markets and restrictions around economic interactions. To score high in this area, countries need to relax regulatory constraints around labor, product and credit markets. For more detail on the construction of each of these areas, see Appendix 1.

The model under consideration uses these areas as explanatory variables. This should help in determining the causal link, or at least, the sign of the relationship, between economic growth and factors determining classical assumptions around economic freedom. The model is as follows

$$GROWTH_{i,(t-5 to t)} = \beta_0 + \beta_1GOV_{i,t-5} + \beta_2LEGAL_{i,t-5} + \beta_3MONEY_{i,t-5} + \beta_4TRADE_{i,t-5} + \beta_5REGULATION_{i,t-5} + \beta_6log(GDP)_{i,t-5} + \varepsilon_{i,t}$$

where the dependent variable represents growth of log GDP per capita over a 5-year period, $$\beta_1$$ through $$\beta_5$$ represent the five areas of EFI at the beginning of each 5-year period, $$\beta_6$$ represents the log of GDP per capita at the beginning of each 5-year period and $$\varepsilon$$ represents the error term. Each of these variables is defined across countries (*i*) and time (*t, t-5*), making this a fixed effects model. Country-level heterogeneity carries a lot of unobservable variables, so with fixed effects, the remaining variation can be used to causally identify the relationships of interest. The null hypotheses are that there is no significant effect between the five areas of EFI and growth of GDP per capita. The alternative hypotheses are that the higher a country scores in all five areas of EFI, the higher the log growth of GDP per capita, in accordance with classical assumptions.

**3. Data**

The data set used for this project was created using three different sources. The EFI was obtained from the Fraser Institute (“Economic Freedom of the World,” 2016), data on GDP per capita was obtained from the World Bank Group (“GDP per capita (current US$) | Data,” 2018), recorded in 2018 US dollars. GDP was chosen to be per capita specifically to avoid any issues with population size differences among countries. Finally, a dummy variable on whether nations are members of the OECD was created using the list of member nations from the OECD website (“OECD - Members and partners,” 2018). These variables are organized as panel data with 52 countries, ranging from 1970 to 2015. Countries were selected based on data availability, to avoid missing values that would result in omitted observations during estimation. Summary statistics (minimum, maximum, mean, and standard deviation) for all variables can be seen in Appendix 2 and graphs representing these variables, faceted by country, can be seen in Appendix 3.
